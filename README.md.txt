The repository is organized into categories based on the type of algorithm or data structure:

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Two-Way Merge Sort
- **Graph Algorithms**
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Prim‚Äôs Algorithm
  - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
  - Knapsack Problem (0/1 Knapsack, Fractional Knapsack)
  - Job Sequencing with Deadlines
- **String Algorithms**
  - Rabin-Karp Algorithm
  - KMP Algorithm
- **Other Algorithms**
  - Huffman Encoding
  - Activity Selection Problem

- **Data Structures**
  - Stack Using Queues
  - Queue Using Stacks
  - Disjoint Set Union (coming soon)

## üöÄ Features

- **Code Examples**: Each algorithm is implemented in Java and includes comments for better understanding.
- **Organized by Category**: Algorithms are grouped by type for easier navigation.
- **Test Cases**: Basic test cases are included for most algorithms to demonstrate usage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Algorithms-DSA-Tutorial.git
   cd Algorithms-DSA-Tutorial
   ```

2. Open the Java files in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or compile and run them from the command line.

3. Test and experiment with the code to understand the implementation.
